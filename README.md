# MNIST-classification-using-Deep-Neural-Networks
Project is about writing an algorithm that detects which digit is written using Deep Neural Networks using Tensor Flow. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.  Goal is to build a neural network with 2 hidden layers.
